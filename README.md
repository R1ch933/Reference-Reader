This web application was created using the Django framework. It is hosted and deployed on Heroku.
This web application is a database that holds a user's docx file and displays its references (if done in MLA).
Users can delete and add files easily.
However, because there is no exclusive server made for this site, when the host puts the app to sleep, all files become corrupt.
This was simply a project done for experience and to be put on a portfolio.
It is fully functional aside from the lack of non-volitile storage.
